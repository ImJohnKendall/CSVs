v,"If you do then post on here what models you want him to diagram and put in a book and also ideas for a book, then maybe he'll read this and see how many people want him to make a book, then he may make one. I know if he did, I would be the first to buy it."
v,"But everyone has to understand that Shuki is the boss, if he says no then it's no."
v,"Though I can't answer for if he should make a book, I would buy it immediately if he did decide to make one."
v,I was talking to him about it and he said that he really wants to make one eventually. He said his primary concern was that he may not have enough models to fill it up.
v,"If he made a book called ""Just Zoanoid Dragon"" I'd probably buy it."
v,"I actualy suggested that to him while we were talking. He said that it is very unlike he would make diagrams for that though, because the first 300 steps would be precreasing and the rest would be hell."
v,"I would definitely buy a book from Shuki Kato. I wouldn't mind if it had only a few models in it, because they are great models!"
v,"Wow, thanks all of you guys!"
v,"Well, I don't believe anyone that posted in this topic is a beginning folder"
v,"(if) you do make one, you should definitely include the crease patterns, also for an added challenge, like Kamiya does with his diagrams."
v,"I would also love to see all those models diagrammed that you posted. They are all great models you made. Would you diagram for the public them, and then release them into a book, or just diagram a few for the public and put the rest into a book? Or not diagram any publicly?"
v,"Either way I will be making diagrams, here's a list of the models I think make the grade:"
v,I am only trying to decide what paper to make them out of. I would love to make them with Origamido but that would cost $60 JUST for the paper.
v,"I love flying insect models, I am planning on making a ""insect collection"" with 6 insect models inside a shadow box and sell it for around $100."
v,Giganotosaurus
v,Flying Kabutomushi or Atlas Beetle (or both? their structures are similar enough that they would share a lot of steps)
v,"Western Dragon v1, v2, or v3 (ditto)"
v,Asuka (needs upgrade before final diagrams)
v,Zoanoid Dragon (maybe...)
v,Evangelion unit 1
v,Ohmu
v,Guyver III
v,shuki.....everyone loves a challenge....your models are AMAZING....and i would fold every one of them....especially the flying insects.....keep up the great work...and KNOW that any book you produced would be embraced and supported by the origami community.
v,"yeah, everybody loves an airborne ant."
v,Spinosaurus (if I can update it to rival Kamiya)
v,Triceratops
v,Dragonfly
v,Goldfish
v,Flying Stag Beetle
v,Flying Hercules Beetle
v,"take a page from berniacki. the books needn't contain dozens of diagrams to be sellable to the origami public. that said, shuki, i think you have a better shot of keeping your sanity if you fill it with some diagrams for intermediate models."
v,"Well yeah, he should, however realshare shall floweth with illegal PDFs free for download. I bet that's partly what he's worried about."
v,Diplodocus
v,Dragonfly
v,Brachiosaurus
v,"If you do the ZD then you could do like the diagrams for andrey's mantis shrimp,"
v,so you don't have to diagram the pre creasing.
v,"That said, I would love to see the EVA, the western dragon, kabutomushi and atlas beetle diagramed."
v,But especialy the EVA.
v,They must be your design or an extremely modifed version of someone elses design in order for you to LEGALLY sell it.
v,"The legality is unclear, contrary to popular belief. But rather than have that argument, what you suggest seems like the right *ethical* thing to do."
v,"Do three books, in a series, that build up to the final one, with the most complicated models."
v,The Works of Shuki Kato: Book 1 (easy)
v,The Works of Shuki Kato: Book 2 (intermediate)
v,The Works of Shuki Kato: Book 3 (complex)
v,and...
v,Shuki Kato: Zoanoid Dragon
v,"Not that we never will see a book by Shuki Kato, just if he cares about marketing, and he knows how many books have fallen dead in sales to the ""realshare disease"", then anyone in their right mind with that knowledge, wouldn't right a book"
v,"or, just pick 15 or 20 of your favorite and best and diagram them into one book, and release the rest for free on the internet (i vote this idea, it saves me money...)"
v,"Yeah, some designers hate it if you make money off of them, whether it's charity or not. I'm not one of those guys and would would think it rather neat if someone sold origami models designed by myself."
v,There's always the e-book and/or app book route. Or sell diagrams individually for a small cost. It's the VERY rare author who can ever expect to make profits from selling books... and not just origami books!
v,"For the book: I actually have quite a few origami designs, 71 that I documented. There's a couple models models I did around 1999- a bear cub and stag beetle - that wouldn't make my grade today, but they do have rather fun folding sequences. I have enough models for a book like Kamiya's if I wanted to go in that direction; Works of Shuki Kato 1999-2011, lol."
v,"ebook would be ok, but i still don't like them. I like the idea of selling single diagrams. A better idea, in my opinion, would be to not actually publish the book, have people send Shuki the money for the book and he would send it back, that way he would make a little more money (book stores keep approximately 40% of the cost)"
v,"There's no question that my best designs were only in the last couple years though, but I'm a bit hesitant to include all of my best models in one book"
v,"you just need to find the site which hosts the file, call the admin and ask him to remove it."
v,"most origami books online are hosted on mediafire (you know how i know so dont start some sh!t about it, people) and most of the admins there are more than happy to use their power to remove copyrighted stuff."
v,"The chest is pretty confusing, but if you keep folding the phoenix and get more experience, you will understand. To my opinion, the chest is like a hidden rabbit ear, the lower triangle in the chest CP is folded like a rabbit ear and the wings hide it and covers it."
v,Tadashi Mori just made a full video for the phoenix. Look it up on Youtube.
v,Does anybody have any suggestions to how big the paper should be? I have 3 foot paper 10 inch paper and some in between. I have not yet folded this model but want to attempt to fold it this week. Thank you in advance.=)
v,Some people folded it from printing out the cp and folding it.
v,"uh, thats a little bit too big."
v,"I used less than a 20 inch sheet of paper. I didn't finish the model though, I just got it precreased and I was too lazy to collapse it, so i threw it away. Tadashimori used a 40 cm sheet, which is about 15 inches."
v,"I've seen that tutorial before, its really useful."
v,"I personally don't like how how does the crease pattern, because if your using the paper I used for it, the creasing gets all screwed up."
v,"48,3"
v,"but the paper i was using was 44cm, i made a mistake typing that, i just noticed."
v,"Thanks! When folding a prime grid, i'm assuming you'd get bigger paper to make up for the bit you cut off? (Surely this is a case of well duh?)"
v,"Out of curiosity, how do you split the paper into 7?"
v,"I can explain the steps he goes through or I'd you still have some computer access, which I assume you do, you can print the fan-diagrams. Googling 3.5 PDF reveals it as the first link. (PM) Many of the processes are similar. If this isn't possible I'll be happy to explain the process Tadashi Mori uses."
v,"Also, i won't be on a computer for ages, and i have perfect paper for this model, smaller than most, but very agile, and light. I can't watch the video, although i will when i get on a computer so what does that video say? I don't mind wasting my time if it means getting started!"
v,everything can be found without a grid. easy.
v,How didn't i (or you) notice??
v,3x9=27
v,Folded the model from the book twice now. The wings are just impossible... let alone in mirror image...
v,"Thanks for the help, i always seem to need sevens (for some reason they always seem to be the perfect size) and 5s, and 3s, although i knew how to do 5s and 3s, but i wasn't very good at 5s. Thanks again!"
v,"Thanks for all your help, i do have computer access, but for only a short time every day. I need that access because my phone can't read PDFs."
v,"1. take an example grid, lets say 27, which is a prime number. therefore, the only factors are 1 and 27. find the nearest number to 27 that is not a prime number. in this case, 28."
v,Are the diagrams not clear?
v,"2. fold the grid of 28. (7, 14, 28)"
v,"i'm sorry to tell you that those diagrams are completely wrong, it is badly drawn. the best advice is photo-diagrams from Chinese forums or pm message me.w"
v,3. cut off 1 unit of 2 sides that are touching each other.
v,not like this: | |
v,but like this: |__
v,(of course the lines represent the edges
v,"for those having difficulty. first off, though kamiya recommends 50 cm, i suggest a larger sheet. the model is definitely doable with 50 cm, but the details of the head get annoyingly small. OTOH, avoid using a sheet that is too large. one of the really annoying thing when you are trying to work on the hardest part (the wings) is that the tail keeps getting in the way! if you use nicolas terry foil, i highly highly recommend taping the tail from the point to the breast of the model--the base of the tail gets really thick, and will tear easily during the final ""braiding."" also, i do not recommend that you use something expensive the first time you try this model. i think you will have to practice it several times before you get the wings to your taste."
v,It doesn't make any difference which way you fold it. Those layers get hidden inside the wing anyway
v,use the preexisting crease in 105 to guide you in make 104.
v,"Thanks for the advice. Been trying this model with 38cm paper, which might be too small, but I haven't had any trouble as of step 112."
v,Can anyone tell me the difference between these two CP of the Phoenix what difference does the red circled part make
v,"Though it seems the paper I've been using--foil backed parchment paper--works really well. It's very strong, albeit a little thick, but there haven't been any issues yet"
v,"steps 174 onward, it does not need to completely match the diagrams. don't throw away your work. proceed. depending on how you did the pleats circa 104-106, it may not match. you should be able to proceed regardless. keep practicing until you get the wings to your taste."
v,"Yes I agree a few minutes after posting i folded a model with both versions in itself, half and half, but still im very curious as to why he changed it. I mean kamiya isnt a rookie hes the best why would there be a change :p maybe im exaggerating"
v,"VERY IMPORTANT at step 176. make sure you grasp the center axis of the layers and keep them from drifting as you shift them over the next few steps. the paper is very thick at this point and there is a natural tendency towards drift. the more it drifts, the more it will look different and you will become worried you are doing something wrong."
v,"Since it doesn't make much difference which way you fold it, he may have changed it to make it easier"
v,"VERY IMPORTANT, each time you shift the layers at 177, make the creases as sharp as you can. this is hard because the paper will be very thick. btw, the best way of thinking of step 177 is a squash fold, not just a shifting of layers. stick a long, thin object into the pleats to help you spread the layers as evenly as possible. this is very much like step 82 of the cerberus."
v,"I personally don't like how how does the crease pattern, because if your using the paper I used for it, the creasing gets all screwed up"
v,"avoid the temptation of making the ""shifts"" of 177 too large in an attempt to ""match"" the diagrams. the larger the shift, the smaller the pleats will end up being, and you will have less room to do the reverse fold-reverse folds of 195-6."
v,"ai guys I've ever tried to do this origami video by Satoshi Kamiya 5 times more paper runs tearing, or all the things I pies, or so I Faso several folds wrong, you do not know any video that is with the diagram?"
v,"the reason why you want to make the creases at 177 as sharp as possible is because in 178-180, you are simply reversing those creases."
v,"EDIT: Nevermind, I finally figured it out (After 2 days, haha), I didn't realise that the back comes up as you fold down. (You fold where kamiya says, but then the layer in front of that gets lifted up, for anyone else who doesn't get it)"
v,What is the best paper to use for the model. Tissue foil?
v,diagree! a nice hand made paper will give the best result
v,kamiya himself used washi paper for his phoenix
v,"I'm stuck at step 54. I don't get how to fold it back, make it look like step 55, and then be able to colapse it properly. Can anyone help? Thanks."
