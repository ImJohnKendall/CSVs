Papercraft is ALL ACCESS and cheap. Tools are universal and printers are everywhere. Can be made without a computer, and done almost anywhere.

There's also the fact that basic papercraft is sort of a training ground or gateway to working in other more permanent mediums- paper mache skills translate to fiberglass and other practices that drape materials over forms like sewing...cutting, rolling and folding paper translates to sheet metal...origami teaches about articulation principles important in engineering...paper allows young people to experiment and learn about this stuff in a cheap and safe manner and then apply them for the rest of their lives.

I just think it's stupid and shared my thoughs. I mean, this has got to stop at some point if we want to move on. Why engage in these agruments anyway and keep on posting actual stuff, content and files instead. If we want to keep the po board functioning that is. Too much history on this baby, the sharing has got to continue, now more than ever. I am not the one to be posting on here really, just lurking in the shadows, but this crap on the site is a bummer and I want the good things to get back. So if everybody stops their stupid agendas and focus on papercraft/origami stuff again, it would get 1000% better. That's my piece of mind about the stuff I am seeing in the last few months I came back to this site again.",,

Either that, or you make it from several sheets.",,
