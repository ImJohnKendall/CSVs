v,"If you do then post on here what models you want him to diagram and put in a book and also ideas for a book, then maybe he'll read this and see how many people want him to make a book, then he may make one. I know if he did, I would be the first to buy it."
v,"But everyone has to understand that Shuki is the boss, if he says no then it's no."
v,"Though I can't answer for if he should make a book, I would buy it immediately if he did decide to make one."
v,I was talking to him about it and he said that he really wants to make one eventually. He said his primary concern was that he may not have enough models to fill it up.
v,"If he made a book called ""Just Zoanoid Dragon"" I'd probably buy it."
v,"I actualy suggested that to him while we were talking. He said that it is very unlike he would make diagrams for that though, because the first 300 steps would be precreasing and the rest would be hell."
v,"I would definitely buy a book from Shuki Kato. I wouldn't mind if it had only a few models in it, because they are great models!"
v,"Wow, thanks all of you guys!"
v,"Well, I don't believe anyone that posted in this topic is a beginning folder"
v,"(if) you do make one, you should definitely include the crease patterns, also for an added challenge, like Kamiya does with his diagrams."
v,"I would also love to see all those models diagrammed that you posted. They are all great models you made. Would you diagram for the public them, and then release them into a book, or just diagram a few for the public and put the rest into a book? Or not diagram any publicly?"
v,"Either way I will be making diagrams, here's a list of the models I think make the grade:"
v,I am only trying to decide what paper to make them out of. I would love to make them with Origamido but that would cost $60 JUST for the paper.
v,"I love flying insect models, I am planning on making a ""insect collection"" with 6 insect models inside a shadow box and sell it for around $100."
v,Giganotosaurus
v,Flying Kabutomushi or Atlas Beetle (or both? their structures are similar enough that they would share a lot of steps)
v,"Western Dragon v1, v2, or v3 (ditto)"
v,Asuka (needs upgrade before final diagrams)
v,Zoanoid Dragon (maybe...)
v,Evangelion unit 1
v,Ohmu
v,Guyver III
v,shuki.....everyone loves a challenge....your models are AMAZING....and i would fold every one of them....especially the flying insects.....keep up the great work...and KNOW that any book you produced would be embraced and supported by the origami community.
v,"yeah, everybody loves an airborne ant."
v,Spinosaurus (if I can update it to rival Kamiya)
v,Triceratops
v,Dragonfly
v,Goldfish
v,Flying Stag Beetle
v,Flying Hercules Beetle
