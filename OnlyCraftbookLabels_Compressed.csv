Do you have the book with the open frame cube? I had it a while ago, but lost it
How many inits did it take to make the menger sponge?
I like the colorplay on the middle star"
v,"(REPLY) >>587322
>open frame cube
not sure which you're referring to

>sponge
don't have a diagram, saw a pic of it and messed around till I had a product, the color pattern is also my own but I don't have a diagram anymore. Unit is very similar to a Phizz unit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlcMwXUqmuI with slight modification you can use these units to make a cube. once you have that you can make the sponge."
x,Here's the only unrelated chance you get. Do with this point what you will (hopefully be garbage).

v,"(REPLY) >>587314
beautiful collection man, and I love the color choices. Idk if the other anon asking about the diagrams was curious about the same model, I'm wondering if you have a diagram for the colourful ring next to the rainbow cube ring (the one mentioned here >>587339), the big circle thingy. Looks amazing.

>>588346
seconding as well, the models look really really neato à²¥ ÍœÊ–à²¥

also wanted to share a pdf that got me started with modular origami but it exceeds the 8mb upload size
is there a good file sharing website without needing to make an account?"
v,"(REPLY) >>587718
Does anyone have this book's full version? All the pdf's i found are from page 9 onwards, but the diagrams for the cube units are on page 8, so I can't find nor make them. Even youtube doesn't have a video tutorial specifically for tomoko fuse's cube so I'm at a loss. I know they may be quite basic but I can't figure out how to make them."
v,"(REPLY) >>590354
Don't have a full version, but it is also described in ""Multidimensional Transformations Unit Origami"" on page 176/177."
v,"(REPLY) >>590355
The tutorial is much appreciated, I've never heard of PHiZZ units before, should be fun

>>590360
thanks! I haven't downloaded it yet so I couldn't check, but I'll do so now

>>590375
oh man, whooooops
I decided I'd do them from easiest to hardest so I didn't even think to check at the very end of the book. Thanks a lot for letting me know!"

Great Tutorial.
I used 9cm Paper, cause I couldn't find anything else. Took about a week and was really fun."

any one have a nice book for these modular origami?"
v,"(REPLY) Resurrecting this thread for the new year

That's an original model, I'm calling it the Snapping Turtle
Do any of you have any wips or recently finished pieces"
v,What're some models I should fold if I've got a ton of sticky notes?
v,"i want to make as big modular origami as i can, any blueprints?"
v,"(REPLY) >>602702
What exactly do you mean by blueprints? If you mean folding diagrams, then download any of the pdfs in this thread. If you mean an overall plan of how the project will come together, then you need to consider size and material.
>as big as i can
is pretty vague. The largest (origami) paper I can find in stores is 35cm, but the length will likely exceed that on the finished model."
v,"(REPLY) >>600914
I wish I was autistic enough to bear cutting the paper into those insane ratios. Honestly the biggest filter for me"
v,"(REPLY) >>603083
Atleast for the original F.I.T. model, dollar bills are almost perfect. The slight oversize makes the fitment rather sturdy."
v,"(REPLY) >>603086
Not American so that trick doesn't work - but I have made F.I.T a good number of times, and a few other wireframes like 10 intersecting triangles and Makalu. But they all have a) not too many units and b) are easy ratios like 1:3 and 1:4 etc. Not some madness like 1.1354453:5.51123121 or whatever bonkers ratios some models require"
v,"(REPLY) >>603164
hi there, the proportion in the dollar bill its 1:(sqrt(2) -1)

you can always grab an A4 paper and make an square. the left paper has that proportion"
v,"(REPLY) >>603614
Thanks for he tip, but like I said before, I have made FIT before"
v,"hey guys, when i was a kid, i used to do lots of modular origami. i could find instructions for all the models i could ever want to make online.

but now, it seems like they're all gone. can i still find them for free or do i need to start paying up cash for books?"

a lot of the images in this thread end in .pdf, you can open them to get the whole book"
