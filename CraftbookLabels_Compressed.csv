no worries man, post it if you make it. i don't have what it takes"
v,"(REPLY) >>539515
some man really did it. it only need some patience. and this clock work, real running"
v,"(REPLY) >>539516
it will take time but yes !"
v,"I'm doing it right now. Just starting tough.
One question, if anyone is building it too, do we have to make the markings for the scores on piece a-05 by ourselves? To fit in piece A-01?"
v,"(REPLY) >>539515
is the same that a metallic pendulum clock... but in paper... soooo can give you a real accuracy"
v,"Anybody knows about other funtional papercraft. I want to do more.
Also here is my progress (at least paper 6, tomorrow im gone print paper 7 and 8, 2 papers for day ) i hope in a month finish
Ignore the mistakes, im not from USA"
v,try gear heart and gear sphere. even harder than this.
v,"(REPLY) >>542304

please, please, anybody have those papercraft?"
v,"look here. it have link for the whole parts for the gear heart

v,"Sorry but i do not understand this part , anybody can explain me?
For what is E6?"
v,Anybody knows about for what it is this piece?
v,"(REPLY) >>542312
I have the gear cube."
v,"(REPLY) >>542312
And the instructions."
v,"(REPLY) >>542629
Thank you so much, i can made this pieces of the clock, and i promise make the cube, this is my compromised"
v,"Well, this is my progress, it was so hard, but im going finish, only some details, 
The piece P1: the piee paper show 5 moldes, when you need 6, make a copy.
And in the intrucction, when you fusion the frame B the sighn of O11 and O10 is it grown, but is a mistake of number, nothing anymore.
About my frame, i started without gears becase the gears are little bend, the glue deformed the paper, so i make a corrections before the fusion of everything pieces.
Sorry for my grammar, im from ecuator."
x,"(REPLY) >>542853
nice work. keep doing this. good luck!"
v,"Do not put L10, because with this piece, the anchor do not fits with the escapement, my solution is put L 10 and L11 together"
v,"Here goes the weith.., really for me,was the most confusion step, for this reason, i made after of all"
x,"(REPLY) >>542890
Good job. Can't wait to see the end result."
v,"I think your paper are too think. After your clock finish, hope still can move without any destruct."
v,"(REPLY) >>542896
i mean too thin."
x,"(REPLY) >>542890
Nice."
v,"(REPLY) >>542896
It is probably, in this case im going use stong material.
in this picture All the gears stay ""in situ"".
The frames suffer the most damage because i needed change for fit the sticks.
The only problem now is separate the gears of other gears.
And the anchor. RECOMENDATION. Do not glue L10, at least, not behind of the anchor, this piece is a long separate innecesary of the teeth of escapement"
x,"Amazing work OP. Keep updating us, please!"
x,nice work !!! keep updating process pls. it very helpful
v,"(REPLY) >>542937
What paper are you using, if you think it's too thick for the mechanism would you suggest using thicker cardstock for the frame and lighter cardstock for the mechanisms? I'm very interested in making this but I live in a shit desert that relies on swamp coolers to fill the air with water and even cardstock warps inside."
v,"Hello it's me, the ecuatorian boy.
The road to this point was difficult, 
The frames fuck everything.
The space between anchor and escapement (her teeth) not fits, yet.
Now i waiting for the dry off the glue.
And the munite hand, i recommend change the step 3 (on the step 38), cut one part of the asis ( or stick) and paste this inside the hole of 12teeth gear type b (the little gear front 48 teeth gear).
 i think so, this is the real impulse of minute hand.
If you only put the minute hand on the asis, this roll without control because the gears more heavy behind them move the asis, and the minute hand, like light piece move on with the rhythm of the other gears.
Again, sorry for my grammar, i started learn with duolingo"
v,"Hello my dear readers.
I belive, i am the only who support this thread alive.
Well, now i in stanby for the clock, only need rise the asis of ancora, everything else is fine, and the hour and minute hand goes in perfect sequence. Maybe later a take a picture.
Here is the gear sphere cube, the first parts. It is like a cupcake cover."
v,wow! patient man :)) can you take pic about how the clock work? how can we run it?
v,This is really cool! Learn how to make gifs or webm because we'd love to see the result in motion!
v,"(REPLY) >>543238
Relax dude, im going use format factory (transformation video), now i make the finals corrections and the pieces of gear sphere, wait 3 days or less, i promise"
v,Dear anon glad to see you build the Paper Clock. I have too started it but stopped a few months ago when my dog ruined part of it (my fault I tested the gears after putting the string on the mechanism and left it on the floor) This urges me to go back and finish it!
x,"(REPLY) >>543252
Thats incredible anon!

v,"(REPLY) >>539515
The vast majority of stuff in a clock is just crap to display the time - that is, almost all the gears are there to divide down the amount of rotation. The fundamental accuracy (or lack) of a clock comes down to two or three main things: the escapement (the escape wheel + pallets), the pendulum, and what powers the escapement.

The escapement is the most critical piece; you have losses due to friction, to how the pallets and the wheel interact, recoil, etc. (See the fine wikipedia article for more detail.) With paper, you have less thermal expansion to worry about, but humidity levels can cause even bigger shifts in size.

For more technical details, I recommend the books ""The Quest for Longitude"" (Andrewes, ed; Harvard) or ""Watchmaking"" (George Daniels)."
v,"(REPLY) >>542937
Holy crap anon, you are a madman. This would be challenging to make as a machinist, much less out of paper."
v,"(REPLY) >>543252
Clock looks awesome. What weight paper did you use and what are the general opinions on sticking paper together to thicken it?"
v,"It is so many work, maybe before the end of this year i can finish the clock, all the problem is the escapement and the anchora, the teeth do not fit.
Another thing, you need 50 grames or more for the weith. And a stick for more resistence
About the gear sphere, i hate make all this axis."
x,"(REPLY) >>546309
its looks gr8"
x,"(REPLY) >>546309
Looking good so far"
v,"(REPLY) >>546309
Hi OP, I made this clock about 6 years ago as a gift for my father. From your pictures I don't think you have made the gears to a fine enough tolerance, are you flooding them with glue too? If a couple of teeth are wonky the mechanism will jam (as I found out) and you will need to use more weight to get it to turn causing the structure to bend.

I have also made the gear heart and this suffers from the same problem you need at most a 1.5mm tolerance on most pieces otherwise it will jam and bend.

Good luck friend."
v,"(REPLY) >>542439
E6 is a supporting piece, it allows you to mount the eyelet punched piece inside the gear for if you are using a hand eyelet punch. If you are using a vertical punch you can ignore it and make the gear completely."
v,"(REPLY) >>547348
Not Op but I plan on making this clock, what do you mean by the tolerances and flooding with glue?"
v,"(REPLY) >>547401
For tolerances I mean that each tooth needs to be as close to the plan as possible, they mesh together very closely. You can flood the teeth with glue if you start to get lazy making the gears and try to rush. Best advice is to glue teeth in pairs at 180 degrees to each other and take it slow. Good luck."
x,"(REPLY) >>547453
I see, thanks anon"
x,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROuPRs_rJi0
v,"Another anon trying to make this here, if I make the gears and harden them with a thin layer of diluted glue even if they don't warp will it mess up the tolerances?"
v,"(REPLY) >>548616
You may need to lightly sand the gear teeth to make sure everything fits smoothly. The only two pieces that really matter in term of tolerances and fit are the anchor and escape wheel."

v,H-03 are small parts for connecting the pieces of the large gears
v,"here's my test build. not using eyelets for this, also did some changes to templates to simplify the work. not working steadily yet, only for a couple of minutes. will introduce a few more tweaks soon"
v,"(REPLY) >>572027
Holy fuck, you actually did. Good job anon! What sort of changes did you do to the templates?"
v,"(REPLY) >>572028
I've changed several curved lines in templates to straight lines, where it doesn't influence the function. It's easier to cut and glue straight lines, obviously. Also, look at the teeth of the gears. They have new flaps design, so the flaps are bigger and easier to glue. This cuts time on glueing gears significantly"
v,"(REPLY) >>572027
It looks like the gears only have one half of the teeth covered, on alternating sides?"
v,"(REPLY) >>572054
yes, this was necessary to allow larger flaps. the original flaps design was a PITA to cut and glue. Larger tabs can be glued to the front, much faster and easier. To have a clean look you just need a second layer of them on the front side (didn't do it here, as this was an experimental build)."

v,Has anyone made one of the cardboard clocks before? This is my third time buying it because I messed up the first two. How do you keep the cardboard layers from warping? Should I not use white glue?
v,"(REPLY) >>577880
I tried the Wrebbit kit like 25 years ago; if it's still the same, the way I did it was to glue everything in the gear together *except* the hub in the middle, and then put the almost-complete gear under a couple of books to keep everything nice while drying. The frames are less critical to keep straight; really, it's the escapement that's the thing that's the most critical to get right."
v,"(REPLY) >>578027
its worth a try. I bought this 3 years ago and havent built it yet but the box is the same as the one I got in 1999 so it hasnt changed.

v,"(REPLY) >>583141
Aw, no need for solipsism. Instead, consider that the fundamental basis of something might be subtle and easily overlooked in favor of its more flashy parts. (And that it took 150 years from the first scientific examination of pendulums to develop a stable clock to become useful for navigation.)

v,I hope OP survived the pandemic
v,"No offence intended, but why is /po/ still its own board? This thread is so old, it has seen 3 different Presidents. And it's not like it was forcefully bumped or anything.
There are less than 10 posts made each day. The board itself has seen just 60,000 posts in the last 5 years, based on OP's post number. In comparison, a high traffic board like /tv/ or /vg/ probably sees 60,000 posts each week.

Unless I'm very much mistaken, /po/ is the least active board of the entire site by a considerable margin. Even /p/ is considerably more active, and that's a ghost town due to it being gatekeeped by gearfags who don't consider you a real photographer unless you delete 95% of what you take.

v,"is /po/ the slowest board?
Also why does this board exist?"
x,what is going on here?
x,"(REPLY) >>549843
i like knowing you keep an eye on it. do you go on this board often?"
v,"(REPLY) >>549902
I've heard people claim a few other boards were slower but this is one of the slowest. We share papercraft templates, origami diagrams and crease patterns and share works we make. We're a bunch of nerds for paper and this is a good place to be one."
x,"(REPLY) >>550189
i think /i/ is slower, it often has older thread anyway.

/u/ is also pretty slow. But at this level comparison doesn't really matter, all these boards are extremelly slow."
v,"(REPLY) >>550056
i love /po/and vist it at least once a week I normally lurk in the origami diagram threads and occasionally answer questions that pop up on /po/"
x,"(REPLY) >>550191
Why are these boards kept around then? I always thought /d/ was so slow because people are wacking it. 

>>550204
I am glad you are still around. Hopefully we keep this going until next halloween."
x,"(REPLY) >>550308
they're kept becuase slow as they are people still use em i guess"
v,"(REPLY) >>550420
I wish 4chan was known for its Papercraft and origami board. That would be so perfect.
