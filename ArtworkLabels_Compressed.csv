x,"AI tools that try to steal artists jobs is actually a good thing now that I think about it. For one, it'll never happen. At best it'll be a useful tool for non-artists to communicate better to professionals what they want from them. And for artists it could speed up the workflow of not having to take too much time during the brainstorming and research process. 

Lets say one day we'll all be able to connect our mind to a brain computer interface and can use these AI tools to generate hundreds of concepts within a minute. This actually saves time and then the artist can go to work on the best concept and paint over it. Then lets say any Joe and Sally can download any artists style they want for their AI generated artwork. No matter what if that artist didn't draw X flavor character of the month the AI has no data on how to replicate it in their style.

The AI will always be playing catch-up with 3 steps behind the originator. Now lets say it gets so damn sophisticated that it's near identical to the original creator no matter what project it tackles. THIS IS A GOOD THING.

I think that's a pretty smart way to work. You study how to draw faces freehand, get good at it and then use technical assistance to do it fast and perfect, while using your fundies to make it look better than the photograph. 

I could see a high risk of getting stuck NEEDING to trace everything because you get rusty at freehand proportion/placement or you fear you will do worse work without it.

yes you can. There's many different types of zines some are centered around some vague theme, which is good to promote original work, or for an official IP. Fanart zines generate the most attention and revenue but original zines can be successful too depending on who the contributors are if you can get an artist with a a large following on board. You can find zine promo accounts and communities fro upcoming zines and apply for some. Usually they are printed by orders digitally from the manager of the zine but you could get your own copy and give them out if you want. Some zines are nonprofit and some are for profit. I don't know much else beyond that since I've never been accepted for one because my art sucks and is ugly."

Comparisons, according to Buddhism, are one of the primary sources of suffering.
You ought not to practice get on the same level or be better than your peers, you ought to practice to fulfill your personal journey to an aspiring artist.

I'm not him but I did cure my anxiety and depression by realizing it was dumb shit not worth wasting energy over, it went away just like that. Start working out, eat healthier and improve your social skills and your life will get better. Also deleting what's keeping you lethargic won't do shit, it's better to learn how to say no to leisure and do something productive instead because that takes choosing one thing over the other which makes you procrastinate less in the long run until one day you actually find more enjoyment in the choice that was once harder to make.

x,"Wanted to try getting into game dev because I'm becoming more confident with my art skills, so I thought all I needed to do was learn to code and I could start making 2D games. Following along with tutorials and seeing the results of my code was actually pretty fun, but then I realized I need to learn how to do sprites AND animate and holy fuck I hate both I think. Especially trying to learn both at the same time is just a painful experience. I just want to go back to coding because that was fun but I don't want to make an ugly game with shitty placeholder assets when the entire reason I was interested in game dev was as a medium to show off my art and designs.
Part of me just wants to totally drop the pixel art and give 3D modeling a shot instead because I tried that and it was kind of fun, but I feel like making a game with 3D models would take way longer than using 2D sprites and it would be too much of a workload for one person that's just doing this as a hobby."

However with stylized drawings it goes straight back to the noun and not the verb action. Which makes life drawing oddly useless...or so I thought. And then I realized I could literally learn the proper way and then ""noun"" my way by tracing over 3D models. I'm onto something...I just have to get through the slogfest that held me back for this long once and for all and then isekai cheat magician my way like Kyle does with tracing models.

Using construction is kind of similar to what you are saying (I think). 
You are using reference to draw but you aren't drawing the person in your reference, you are drawing simple 3D shapes that resemble the model. Then you are adding smaller 3d shapes and anatomical details to trick people into thinking you actually drew a person instead of a 3d mannequin. 

For a good likeness you have to go back to 2d shape design to get it exactly right but you can do that on top of the 3d mannequin you made. 

I think it is a good conditioning technique to abstract and separate what you see vs what you are drawing. You always categorising what you see into pre-existing compartments in your head, these compartments are constructed and maintained by studying. 

It's funny that the first thing you learn is that symbol drawing is bad. What they should actually say is that your current method of symbol drawing is bad and we need to reset you so you can learn a good method of symbol drawing, involving both 2d and 3d symbols."

Yeah pretty much. I just wish I could find someone who does this process.

I don't know, personally I would like all those people to go to reddit. The place was created to be a hugbox echo-chamber, you don't interact with anything you dislike and the upvote system makes sure nothing they would dislike shows up so they would feel validated all the time and not feel the necessity of virtually signalling to anything for internet points. So retards like that would just fuck off to the hole in the ground and we would know exactly who they are and what they think instead of just looking like ""the mob"".

Could also be bad, but reddit is probably one of the last bastions of this sort of ""internet culture"" after tumblr died and if twitter changes for the better, they don't have much of a choice left. Could also be discord, but is far too different of a plataform to work as a substitute."
